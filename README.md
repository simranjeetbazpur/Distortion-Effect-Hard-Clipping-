# Distortion-Effect-Hard-Clipping-
#Using Python 3.6
STEPS TO RUN:
1. simranjeet.wav file is converted to simranjeet.dat using SoX command i.e sox simranjeet.wav simranjeet.dat[You can skip this step as I have uploaded the simranjeet.dat file as well].
2. Remove first two header lines in the file simranjeet.dat and then use it in python.[I have already edited the simranjeet.dat file so this step can also be skipped]
3. temp.py is the python script you need to run.[I have run it using Spyder in Anaconda]
4. The python script takes the input simranjeet.dat and convert it into out.dat[Also waveforms will be displayed on the spyder console]
5. out.dat can be converted to out.wav using command sox out.dat out.wav


#For listening to sound import .wav files(simranjeet.wav and out.wav) in audacity and play the sound.You can see the difference between two sounds.
#NOTE: simranjeet.wav is input and out.wav is the output produced after distortion.
#waveforms can be seen in the console itself.
